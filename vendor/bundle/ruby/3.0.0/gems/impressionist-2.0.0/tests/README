Impressionist uses MiniTest

tests/test_app still uses rspec. However it is going to be changed.

to run tests one shoud:
  * bundle install
  * rails g impressionist
  * rake db:migrate && rake db:test:prepare
  * rake      # runs both code base tests and rails tests
  * rake test # impressionist's tests
  * rake spec # rails test api
